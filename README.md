# Module-5-Challenge
The code for this project is found in the Pymaceuticals folder in the file pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb.
When not sure what code to use or how to use it, I refered to class notes, instructor examples, a class study group, and, per instructor recommendation, utilized ChatGPT to help learn how to do it. Otherwise, no other code or outside resources were used.
